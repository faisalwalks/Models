# Models
3D printable STL files and CAD files of Schwarz D, Gyroid and Spherical Gyroid.
I used the open source software called MathMod to create a mesh file of the structures with the given porosity.
Exported the mesh files as .OBJ.
I imported the .OBJ files in Autodesk NetFabb to scale the mesh and measure its Surface Area and volume.
NetFabb is capable of exporting the .OBJ files as .STL
