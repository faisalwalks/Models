# Models
3D printable STL files and CAD files of Schwarz D, Gyroid and Spherical Gyroid.
I used the open source software called MathMod and exported the mesh files as .OBJ.
I imported the .OBJ files in Autodesk NetFabb to scale th mesh and measure its Surface Area and volume.
NetFabb is capable of exporting the .OBJ files as .STL
